Summary
----------
Module defining abstract storages. There are two main classes that communicate using an `IO` object such as `io.BytesIO`, `io.StringIO`:    

    - :class:`AbstractStorage` which represents a storage space (directory on disk, space on server, database file, hdf5 file, share_memory, ...). 
        This class is responsible for creating the IO object (for example the :meth:`pathlib.Path.open`) at the right location.
    - :class:`AbstractIOProtocol` which handles how a python variable is exported/loaded to/from data (e.g. binary data, string, ...) to an IO Object.

They both have a listed set of `io_methods` with which they are compatible. 
The user of this module needs to find an io_method compatible with both ends. 
Then the tuple (:class:`AbstractStorage`, io_method, :class:`AbstractIOProtocol`) defines a storage solution to load and dump variables.

    Abstract base class representing a storage.
    A storage may be a directory on disk, a directory on a server, a database, an hdf5 file, but also a dictionary in memory, a dictionary in memory in a different process, ...

    This class is meant to interact well with the AbstractIOProtocol class and the AbstractImportExportFormat class.

    ----------
        name: str
            Should be unique for every storage

    TODO

    def get_ressource_location(self, uniqueid: AlphaNumString, name_info: Any = None) -> StorageLocation: 
        """
        Returns where a ressource with uniqueid and name_info is stored on this storage. In other words, it transforms a unique_id into a location on this storage.
        This enables one to use the same uniqueid for different storages, and retrieve the corresponding location for each storage.

        Guarantees (even across executions)
        ----------
            - if unique_id1 != unique_id2 then s.get_ressource_location(unique_id1, name_info_x) != s.get_ressource_location(unique_id2, name_info_y)

        Pitfalls 
        ----------
            The name_info parameter us purely decorative and is only optionaly used by the storage to provide more readable locations. 
            - To ensure that one gets a different location (necessary to store a different ressource),
            one should use a different unique_id. Simply using a different name_info is not enough.

            - To ensure that one gets the same location, one should pass the same unique_id and the same name_info
        
        Parameters
        ----------
            uniqueid: AlphaNumString
                the identifier of the location. Usually not human readable (result of an hash).
            name_info: Any, optional
                additional information that may be used by the storage to provide a more readable location.
                This is mainly used to specify the extension in case of a file storage.
